    INSTRUCTIONS:
    You simply need to put the full directory path to your ListMessenger directory
    in this variable called $LM_PATH.

    By default $LM_PATH = "../"; you only need to change this if you move the public
    directory outside of the ListMessenger application directory. Another example
    of a full directory path, may be something like:

    /home/httpd/vhosts/domain.com/httpdocs/listmessenger/
    - OR -
    d:/websites/domain.com/public_html/listmessenger/

    This is not a URL, do not put the website address to your ListMessenger folder.
*/

// Directory Path (not URL) with trailing slash to your ListMessenger program directory.
$LM_PATH = '../';
