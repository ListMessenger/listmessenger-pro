## Resurrection

ListMessenger Pro has seen no substantial updates in over 12 years now. With no
significant development initiatives planned, it came time to either officially
retire the project or open up the software to the community and hope others
would assist in maintaining it. SirLogic, a ListMessenger user who has been
maintaining his own implementation of ListMessenger, asked if I would consider
open-sourcing the project, so this is another step in that direction.

A sincere thank you to everyone who has supported ListMessenger over the years.
May this next step be the first of many. -Matt Simpson
