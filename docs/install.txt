Version:	2.2.3
Website:	https://listmessenger.com
================================================================================

SHORT VERSION OF INSTRUCTIONS:

1)	Unpack ListMessenger Pro 2.2.3 distribution file and upload the contents
	to a directory on your web-server.

2)	Point your web-browser to the directory, and follow the instructions:
	Example: http://www.domain.com/listmessenger

================================================================================

LONGER VERSION OF INSTRUCTIONS:

STEP 1)
	Unpack ListMessenger Pro 2.2.3 with any upzip / untar program. The
	extracted directory will be named "listmessenger-pro-2.x.x" or something
	to that effect; it would be a good idea to rename this extracted directory
	to "listmessenger", "mailinglist" or something similar.

STEP 2)
	Upload the entire ListMessenger directory tree (all folders and files)
	to a web-server which meets the following system requirements:
	-> PHP 8.0
		\_ pSpell is required for spell checking support.
		\_ ListMessenger uses many of PHP's built in functions which cannot
		   be disabled, such as: file_exists, fopen, fread, fwrite, ini_set
		   ini_get, fsockopen, ob_start, session_start.
	-> MariaDB 10.1+ or MySQL 5.5+

STEP 3)
	The following directories, which by default reside within the ListMessenger
	program directory need to be writable by the user that your web-server
	and / or PHP runs as. This can generally be done through your FTP client
	such as Filezilla, Transmit, CuteFTP, and setting the permissions to 777.

	- public/files
	- public/images
	- private/backups
	- private/logs
	- private/tmp

	Unix / Linux Web-Servers:
	Please chmod the those directories to 777 using either your FTP client
	or by command line by entering "chmod 777 directoryname".

	Windows Web-Servers:
	I believe that on most Windows servers directories are already writable
	by the user in which your web-server runs; however, if they are not then
	you should be able to set this information by right clicking on the
	directories and allowing everyone to read / write data to them.

STEP 4)
	Point your web browser to the ListMessenger setup program located in
	the ListMessenger program directory and follow the on-screen instructions.

	Example: http://www.domain.com/listmessenger/setup.php

STEP 5)
	After the installation has been completed, make sure you delete the
	setup.php file AND setup directory from the ListMessenger directory root.
